What is Pandas?
        Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.

        It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

        The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.


ðŸ”° 1. Introduction to Pandas
    Pandas makes it easy to handle large datasets efficiently. It provides:

    Data Structures: Series (1D) & DataFrame (2D)
    Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Handling missing values, duplicates, renaming columns
    Data Analysis: Sorting, filtering, aggregating
    Data Visualization: Integrated with Matplotlib & Seaborn


ðŸ”§ 2. Installing and Importing Pandas

Before using Pandas, install it via pip:
    pip install pandas


Now, import it:
    import pandas as pd



Why Use Pandas?
    Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

    Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

    Relevant data is very important in data science.


What Can Pandas Do?
Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:

    Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
    What is average value?
    Max value?
    Min value?
Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.



What is Pandas Used for?

    Reading and writing data from various file formats like CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.
    Cleaning and preparing data by handling missing values and filtering entries.
    Merging and joining multiple datasets seamlessly.
    Reshaping data through pivoting and stacking operations.
    Conducting statistical analysis and generating descriptive statistics.
    Visualizing data with integrated plotting capabilities.
